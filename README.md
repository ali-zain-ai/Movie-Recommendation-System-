# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

This is a **Movie Recommendation System** built with **Python and Streamlit**.  
The goal of this project is to recommend movies similar to the one selected by the user, based on different features like genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview.  

It is a **Content-Based Recommendation System** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Cosine Similarity** to measure how closely related two movies are.

## üöÄ Project Overview
The system works in two main parts:

1. **Data Preprocessing & Model Building (`Main.py`)**
   - Used the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset** (movies + credits) from Kaggle.
   - Merged and cleaned the dataset, keeping only the necessary columns:
     - `genres`, `keywords`, `title`, `cast`, `crew`, `overview`
   - Extracted features like:
     - Genres of the movie
     - Keywords describing the movie (superhero, friendship, space, etc.)
     - Cast (top 3 actors)
     - Crew (director name)
     - Overview (short description of the movie)
   - Combined all these features into a single **tags column**.
   - Applied **text preprocessing**:
     - Tokenization
     - Removing spaces
     - Converting text to lowercase
     - Stemming using **NLTK PorterStemmer**
   - Converted text into numerical vectors using **CountVectorizer**.
   - Calculated **Cosine Similarity** between all movies to measure similarity.

2. **Recommendation Web App (`app.py`)**
   - Built with **Streamlit**.
   - User selects a movie from the dropdown.
   - System recommends **Top 5 similar movies** using precomputed similarity scores.
   - Simple and interactive UI for quick recommendations.
